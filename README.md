# ER-AutoRuneFarm
This is an Elden Ring automatic AFK rune farm using AutoHotKey
Good mid to late-game rune farm, meant for levels under 200

Equipment needed:
- AutoHotKey installed on PC
- In game:
- Bow with mighty shot
- Plenty of arrows
- Mohgwyn palace "Palace Approach Ledge-Road" site of grace

Before starting, make sure to set the "Palace Approach Ledge-Road" site of grace as the first marked site of grace in the map
Activate the script, and sit back while rune farm works
After using all 99 arrows in inventory, the script will stop automatically, allowing you to rest at the site of grace and replenish your arrows

NOTES:
- This was tested on patch 1.05, not sure if these rune farms still work in the 1.06 patch
- There are cases where the bird does not fall off the ledge, in which case you will still be in a combat state, which results in a waste of 3 arrows and some time, will try to find a way to fix this soon
- Will also make a script for the other rune farm at Mohgwyn palace which is much more efficient soon
- The code is really scuffed right now, I'm just starting to learn AutoHotKey, it'll be better in the future

CHANGELOG:
August 17, 2022: Created script version 1.0
